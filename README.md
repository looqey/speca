# Speca - Data Specification and Transformation for PHP

Speca is a **flexible** and **powerful** implementation of data classes designed for seamless interaction with external systems (such as API DTOs) and efficient data flow management across different domains. Inspired by **domain-driven design (DDD)** principles, Speca provides a **structured and adaptable** approach to handling data transformations.

## Why Speca?

- **Automatic property population** – No more manual assignments. Speca maps input arrays directly to object properties.
- **Attribute-based parsing and serialization** – Fine-tune how data is handled using PHP attributes.
- **Lazy properties** – Optimize performance by loading data only when needed.
- **No external dependencies** – Speca is built purely on PHP's native capabilities, ensuring compatibility and minimal footprint.

With Speca, data structures become more than just objects—they represent **specifications**, defining how data is parsed, transformed, and serialized across your application.

## Installation

Install Speca via Composer:

```bash
composer require looqey/speca
```
